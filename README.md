# Project Overview

This repository contains the research and analysis conducted for the MATH 398 final project at Mines Park, focusing on a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the wastewater treatment facility data. In April 2010, a significant system fault occurred at the Mines Park wastewater treatment facility, which disrupted operations for over two months. Our project aims to dissect the events leading up to the fault by analyzing the data collected during the period of April-May 2010. The goal is to uncover underlying factors that contributed to the fault and provide actionable recommendations to prevent future occurrences.

## Objectives

- **Fault Analysis**: To conduct a detailed examination of the wastewater data to pinpoint the primary contributors to the system fault.
- **Recommendation Development**: To leverage our findings to formulate practical suggestions for the facility's operational improvements.
- **Data Visualization**: To utilize various graphical representations to illustrate key trends and anomalies that preceded the fault.

## Methodology

The analysis utilizes a dataset containing over 40,000 observations with 42 different types of measurements taken at the facility. Techniques involved in the EDA include time series analysis, anomaly detection, and trend analysis. Each variable was scrutinized to understand its behavior prior to and following the system fault, with a particular focus on the sewage flow rates and MBR tank levels.

## Results

Our findings indicate that a slow and steady increase in sewage flow, combined with critically low levels in the MBR tanks, were the significant factors that led to the system fault. These insights are visualized through a series of plots that highlight the deviations from normal operational patterns.

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we suggest implementing an automated alert system for critical measurements and enhancing onsite monitoring to swiftly address anomalies before they escalate into more severe issues.

## Further Exploration

Future work could involve applying machine learning techniques to predict potential faults or using a larger dataset to validate our findings and refine our recommendations.
